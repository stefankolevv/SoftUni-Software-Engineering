    <p>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries#creating_complex_media_queries</p>

    <h2>Combining multiple types or features</h2>

    <p>The and keyword combines a media feature with a media type or other media features. This example combines two media features to restrict styles to landscape-oriented devices with a width of at least 30 ems:</p>

    <pre>@media (min-width: 30em) and (orientation: landscape) {
    body::before {
        display: block;
        content: 'The viewport width is larger than 30em and the orientation is landscape.';
    }
}</pre>

    <h2>Testing for multiple queries</h2>

    <p>You can use a comma-separated list of media queries to apply styles when the user's device matches any one of various media types, features, or states.</p>

    <pre>@media (min-height: 680px), screen and (orientation: portrait) {
    body::before {
        display: block;
        content: 'The viewport height is larger than 680px or the media type is screen and the orientation is portrait.';
    }
}</pre>

    <h2>Inverting a query's meaning</h2>

    <p>The not keyword inverts the meaning of a single media query. For example, the CSS styles in this media query will apply to everything except printed media:</p>

    <pre>@media not (min-width: 600px) {
    body::before {
        display: block;
        content: 'The view port is NOT larger than 600px';
    }
}</pre>
</body>
